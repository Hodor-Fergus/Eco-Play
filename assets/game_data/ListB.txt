Inefficient Heating Systems: Many Belgian households use old, inefficient heating systems that consume more energy than necessary.

Poor Insulation: Homes with poor insulation allow heat to escape in winter and cool air to escape in summer, leading to higher energy consumption.

Unsealed Windows and Doors: Gaps and cracks around windows and doors can cause significant energy loss, forcing heating and cooling systems to work harder.

Overuse of Appliances: Running appliances like dishwashers and washing machines with partial loads increases energy consumption.

Standby Power: Devices left on standby mode continue to consume energy, contributing to unnecessary energy use.

Excessive Lighting: Using more lights than needed and not turning off lights when leaving a room leads to higher energy consumption.

High Water Heater Settings: Setting water heaters too high wastes energy by keeping water hotter than necessary.

Old Appliances: Older appliances often have lower energy efficiency ratings, consuming more power than modern, energy-efficient models.

Overheating or Overcooling: Setting thermostats too high in winter or too low in summer results in excessive energy use for heating and cooling.

Frequent Use of Dryers: Using electric dryers instead of air-drying clothes increases household energy consumption.

Continuous Use of Fans and Air Conditioners: Running fans and air conditioners even when not needed wastes significant amounts of energy.

Lack of Energy Management: Not using programmable thermostats or energy management systems can lead to unnecessary energy use.

Improper Maintenance of Heating and Cooling Systems: Neglecting regular maintenance of HVAC systems reduces their efficiency, leading to higher energy consumption.

Overuse of Hot Water: Taking long showers and overusing hot water in household chores increases energy consumption.

Leaving Devices Plugged In: Keeping devices like laptops, televisions, and chargers plugged in when not in use wastes energy.
